We investigate the exponential distribution. With the central limit theorem we compare the theoretial population distribution with the distribution of 1000 samples of 40 exponentials.

We set $\lambda$ = 0.2, therefore $\mu$ = 1/$\lambda$ and sd = 1/$\lambda$

```{r}
set.seed(100)
#exponential distribution
lambda <- 0.2
exponentials <- rexp(1000, rate = lambda)
#matrix of 1000 simulations of samples of size 40
n_sim <- 1000
sample_size <- 40
m <- matrix(rexp(n_sim*sample_size, rate = lambda), nrow = n_sim, ncol = sample_size)
#vector of 1000 averages of samples
sample_averages <- apply(m, 1, mean)
```
1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.

```{r}
theoretical_mean <- 1/lambda
mean_sample <- mean(sample_averages)
```

2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

```{r}



```


```{r} 
hist(sample_averages, breaks = 50, col = "grey", prob = TRUE)
```
